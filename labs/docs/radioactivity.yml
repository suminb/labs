  The project radioactivity had started in March of 2011 in an attempt to help
  the general public to be alerted regarding the spread of radiation and other
  radioactive materials originated from the catastrophic incident in the
  Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, by providing visual information of
  city-wise radition levels.

  As of September of 2012, Sumin Byeon, the lead developer of the project, has
  decided to discontinue the project due to lack of resources. This project
  will be no longer maintained nor developed any further. If anyone wants to
  continue to work on this project, you are more than welcome to fork this
  repository and start your own. Pull requests will be gladly accepted as well.

  For the record, it looks like this:
